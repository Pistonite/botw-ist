# E2E Tests
## How to add a test
1. Make up a name for the test
2. Write the script in simulator
3. Export the script and put it as `<name>.in.txt` in `src/__tests__`
4. Write another script that uses `init`, `init gamedata`, `save`, `save as` and `break x slots` and other commands to achieve the expected result as the first script (look at one of the existing tests as an example)
5. Export the new script and put it as `<name>.out.txt` in `src/__tests__`
6. Create a new file `<name>.e2e.ts`
7. copy paste the following and replace `<name>` with the name of your test. Replace `YOUR_NAME` with your name
```typescript
// Author: YOUR_NAME
const TEST = "<name>";
it(TEST, ()=>{
	expect(TEST).toPassE2ESimulation();
});
export {};
```
8. Make a PR on https://github.com/iTNTPiston/botw-ist
## How to run E2E tests
`npm run test-all`

## How to debug E2E tests
1. Open the `e2e.ts` file of the failed test
2. replace `it` with `it.only`
3. replace `toPassE2ESimulation()` with `toPassE2ESimulation(true)` (i.e. type `true` in the parenthese)
4. Run the test again, you should see 3 files in the test folder:
    - `debug.expected.log` and `debug.actual.log` containing the expected and actual content of the simuation states.
    - `debug.mismatch.log` containing parts of the states that are different
5. After fixing the test, revert the changes to `e2e.ts` you made

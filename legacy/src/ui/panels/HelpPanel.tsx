                    or IST, is a glitch in BOTW that desyncs the number of items
                    you have in the inventory and number of items

                    . By making the game thinks we have fewer items than we
                    actually do, all sorts of crazy things can happen.

                    Because the things that can happen are too crazy, I made
                    this tool to help visualize what is happening in the
                    inventory and in the game internally for each step in an IST
                    setup.

                    If you are totally new to IST, you might find this tool
                    intimidating. However, it is still a good document for IST
                    setups. You can import setups made by others to see the
                    inventory in each step so you can follow along in game.

                <Description>
                    If you are familiar with the general steps in IST setups
                    like pick up, drop, buy, sell, break slots, etc, this will
                    be a great tool to help you route and optimize your setups.

                    On the left, there is the{" "}
                    <span className="Highlight">Steps</span> panel where you can
                    add/remove/change steps. Each step is a command that tells
                    the simulator to simulate an action in the game. I spent a
                    great amount of time to make the language close to a
                    human-readable language, so you can understand without
                    knowing the details of each command

                    Clicking on a step will open to the right the current

                    Don't worry. IST is very complicated, which is why this tool
                    exists. Here are some more resources/tips that can help with
                    IST.

                    If you still can't fully understand IST, that's completely
                    fine. Most people just memorize the setup for specific
                    categories that people made.

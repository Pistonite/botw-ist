## Development
### Clone Repo
Clone repo with `--recurse-submodules`

If you have already cloned, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Install/Update
To update submodules, go to the submodule directory and pull. Example:
```
cd scripts/base-lint
git pull
cd scripts/typescript-layers
git pull
```

To install node modules `npm install`

### Local
Run `npm run start` to start webpack dev server.
When code changes, the dev server will hot reload

### Grammar
The simulator uses a LL parser with infinite look ahead to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree from which commands are parsed.

The grammar is at `src/core/command/ast/grammar.txt` and the ast parser is generated with `npm run generate` (Python needed)

If you want to introduce new commands, most of the heavy lifting for the parsers is already done. You should be able to define a new derivation in the grammar and implement the parser by looking at one of the `parse.cmd.*` files. However, you should probably contact the maintainer to have a discussion about the new command.

### PR
Do before PR:
- Lint your code
  1. `npm run lint-base`: This checks that your files have unix line endings, have no traling whitespaces, and have exactly 1 trailing new line. This might fail if you have auto crlf on git for windows. If you do, **please make sure the remote still has UNIX line ending so the PR automation passes**. To debug unexpected errors, run again as `npm run lint-base -- -v` to see which file is failing
  - `npm run layer`: This makes sure your imports follow the layer rules (and are sorted correctly)
    - `src/data` is the bottom layer. It cannot depend on core or ui components
    - `src/core` is the core logic. It can depend on data, but not ui
    - `src/ui` is the ui layer. It can depend on everything
  - `npm run lint-ts`: This is the standard eslint
- Run tests `npm run test-all`

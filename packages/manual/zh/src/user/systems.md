# Systems in the Simulator
Skybook aims to be a 100% accurate IST simulator. To achieve that, it *emulates*
subsystems of the game as much as possible. However, not all subsystems can be emulated,
especially those that are not reversed-engineered fully or not at all. Some subsystems
also may not be worth to emulate since a simulation is good enough.

The systems that are involved in the simulator include:
- Inventory
- GameData
- [Saves](../action/save.md)
- [Screens](./screen_system.md)
- [Overworld](./overworld_system.md)

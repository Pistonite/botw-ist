```admonish danger
The repository must not contain any assets or data from BOTW, or any file
derived from assets or data from the game. PRs containing such files
will be closed.

Please reach out to me if you want to add something that depends on
the game files.
```
```admonish tip
The project development is on [GitHub](https://github.com). You will need a GitHub
account to contribute. See [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
for the basics of working with GitHub and `git`.

# Developer Manual

This section is highly technical and only intended for people 
who work with or are interested in the IST simulator as a developer.
For example:
  - Contributing to the project
  - Building extensions for the simulator
  - Integrating components of the simulator to other things

The following chapters assume you have basic programming knowledge.
The IST Simulator is built with TypeScript, Rust and some Python scripts
for data processing. Familiarity in at least one of these languages will
help with understanding.

It is recommended that you start with [`Architecture`](./arch/index.md)
if you want to contribute code.

# The reason to drop before autosave is that this autosave will later be used to do corruption. Otherwise we need to hold & drop materials for each corruption.
# After pickingup the items, save immediately. This manual save protects the 2 autosaves above. (An autosave in the future is only protected when the manual save is further in future)
Save
# After manual save, go to Switch system settings to move clock 1 day to the past. This would protect the above autosaves from being overwritten.
# Just as reminder here, don't forget to drop the branches before IST
